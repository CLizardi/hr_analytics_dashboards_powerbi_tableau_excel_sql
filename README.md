The HR Analytics Dashboards project aims to leverage various data visualization and analysis tools to provide meaningful insights into HR data. By analyzing key HR metrics, such as job satisfaction, attrtion rates, education, and age, these dashboards can assist HR professionals in making informed decisions and identifying areas for improvement.

# What I Did
In this project, I developed a set of HR analytics dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and SQL. I gathered HR data from various sources, cleaned and transformed it using SQL queries and Excel functions, and then visualized the data using Power BI and Tableau. The dashboards cover a wide range of HR metrics, including employee demographics, performance analysis, attrition rates, and department analysis. Each dashboard provides interactive visualizations and filters to allow users to explore the data and gain actionable insights.
